# Bit

A simple and safe way to learn git. The primary goal of this project is make a tool to help people learn how to use git. The secondary goal is to make a fun and opinionated high level tool.

# Development

Set up Golang and Glide (https://github.com/Masterminds/glide).

```shell
go get github.com/ArcherWheeler/bit
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ArcherWheeler/bit
glide install
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
go install
```

Bit should now work from the command line.

# More coming soon?
